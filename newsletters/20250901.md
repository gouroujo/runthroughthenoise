**Colombia**: Join us as we kick off our Colombian adventure in Medellin! Julie revisits this vibrant city, but this time we take a well-deserved breather, enjoying a slower pace of life. Think running, home-cooked meals, and a cozy apartment stay. It‚Äôs a delightful reminder that sometimes, it‚Äôs okay to just pause and soak in the moment. Curious about our week? Check out the full post [here](https://runthroughthenoise.com/posts/colombia).

**Panama & the Sans Blas**: Ever heard of Santiago de Veraguas? Neither had we until we found ourselves there, prepping for the Ultra Trail Panama!
