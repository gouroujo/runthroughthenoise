Our trip around the world isnâ€™t just a trip - it is a mission to leave a positive impact on the communities we visit along the way. For this, we are travelling in partnership with [TeamUp](https://teamup.world/), an organization bringing hope to the world through sport.

Using sport as their vector, TeamUp assists communities across the world to provide opportunity, hope, and a the power to create a better life for both individuals and the communities as a whole. Beyond giving children the gift of sports, they assist and empower both children and adults to become leaders in their communities and work together to create positive, lasting change.
