Two months in Peru working with our NGO partner TeamUp, hiking and trail running in the Cordillera Blanca, and travelling through the country with Jonathanâ€™s sister, niece, and nephew! 

Highlights include: 6 days around the Huayhuash mountain range, seeing Humbolt penguins and sea lions on the Ballestas islands, white water rafting in the Chili river, sand skiing in the desert, hiking the colca canyon, relaxing and soaking up the local culture of Lake Titicaca, and finally hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.
