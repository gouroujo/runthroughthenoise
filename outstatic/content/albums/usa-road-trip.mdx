We arrived in **Florida** at the end of February, marking the end of our boat hitch-hiking adventure. Our first stop was a week of decompression at our friend's house in **Tampa**, and included a trip to the **NASA center** and a Phillies pre-season baseball game, tickets curtesy of a friend of Julie's who works for the team.

We then made our way to **New Orleans** to celebrate Mardi Gras and learn about the local history and culture, including a visit to the **Whitney Museum**, an old cotton plantain, to learn more about the history of slavery in the US.

We finally made our way around to Texas, where we camped in **Enchanted Rock State Park**, before our final stop in San Antonio, where we took a night bus into **Mexico**.
