The last time I wrote an update blog post, I was writing to you from a beach chair from our lovely little hotel in Guadeloupe. This time, I writing to you from the couch/bench-thing in our AirBnB in the town of Saint John’s, Antigua. It’s also New Years Day, so as you can imagine quite a lot has happened since then!

To start, after our three nights of (affordable) luxury in Fleur d’Epee in Guadeloupe, we rented a car so that we could better explore the island. Having a car is pretty necessary in Guadeloupe, as the buses are not overly reliable and limited as to where they can take you. Taxis are also few and far between - they don’t drive around, you have to call the taxi company and book in advance in order to use them. So we got a car and set off exploring. That first day out of the hotel was really just us walking two kilometers back to Pointe a Pitre with our very heavy backpacks (we missed the bus), taking a bus in the direction of the car rental place, then walking another kilometer or so to the car rental place to pick up the car. In the carribean heat, this wasn’t the most fun part of our day. We got our car, however, and with that we moved onto our second stop: Decathalon.

For those reading this who are not French/European, Decathalon is a sports and outdoors store that has everything for the active person. Whether it’s camping, surfing, trail running, going to the gym, fishing, mountain climbing - they’ve got it all. We went there because we decided that we made a mistake when purchasing our backpacks and therefore needed to purchase different bags. The problem was that our bags were just big enough to fit everything, making them annoying and difficult to pack, open, and close. Not super practical. So we went to Decathlon, spent at least an hour debating the merits of various bags and other items that we decided we needed, before then going to the grocery store to buy food for dinner that night.

Jo had read that there were a few places in Guadeloupe where people often camped and slept in hammocs, so our plan was to do just that for that evening. Our Decathlon and grocery trip took quite a long time, however, so when we arrived at the beach where we would be hammoc camping, it was already almost dark. It was in that moment that I realized: I was quite nervous about sleeping near a public beach in a hammoc. We set up our hammocs, made dinner, and then got prepared to settle in for the night: Me in my hammoc, Jo in his just below me. This, however, was when I really started getting nervous. At one point a guy walked past where we were and I truly began to feel panicky. It turns out, that guy  was also hammoc camping and set up at the picnic site just ways down from us. Jo could practically feel my anxiety permeating through my hammoc down towards him, and tried to comfort me. About 20 minutes later, however, he asked me if I was sleeping yet, to which I responded that no, I wasn’t, and that I didn’t think I would fall asleep, feeling far to jumpy. It turns out he was also feeling nervous, moreso because the car was further away than he would’ve like with many of our things in it. With that, we packed up camp and instead decided to car camp that night, aka sleep in the car in the beach parking lot. We removed the seats out of the back and stacked them, along with our bags, in the front seat. We then blew up our sleeping pads and rolled up sweater to use as pillows. It wasn’t too bad in terms of comfort, except for one problem: It very quickly became very hot inside the car. We opened the windows to make the temperature at least potentially sleepable, with which came another problem: Mosquitoes. Jo then had the brilliant idea to jimmy rig mosquito screens using the built-in ones on our hammocs, which seemed to solve the problem.

I wish we could say we slept well after that, but between the less than comfotable conditions and being interrupted several times by cars that kept arriving in the parking lot with their bright lets and people talking loudly, not really. At one point, the police even came by and shone their headlight directly at our car, which we think was because they saw that our windows were down. Once we stuck our heads up and they saw us, though, it was all good and they drove away. The next morning, we realized that everyone else who had shown up throughout the night was also camping on that beach. It did say online that the spot was popular!

We booked an Airbnb for the next night and did some exploring on the part of the island called Grand Terre. We did a small amount of hiking (in torrential rain and crazy winds), but at least we knew we had a comfortable and dry place to sleep that night. After that we decided to go over the the part of the island called Basse Terre, which is the mountainous region, with lots of hiking, waterfalls, and beaches with great snorkeling. One of the days, we rented a kayak and paddled out to Pigieon Island (surprisngly empty of pigieons) and snorkled there, which was a great experience and I would recommend to anyone going to Guadeloupe.

We did another night of car camping, which we did at the sight of a trail head, where we were planning to do a two-day hike. This is one where you hike to a refuge in the mountain, then hike back the next day. The car camping was, yet again, not the best, and when we started the hike the next morning neither of us were in the best mood. This is when we realized neither of us were actually feeling great about taking two days to do this hike, as we were feeling stressed about finding a boat that would take us further along our route towards the Dominican Republic. We decided to abandon the hike and instead book accomodation near to the harbour where we thought we should be to find a boat to take us further north.

We found an affordable apartment not far from the harbour in Deshaies, where we knew if boats were going to be heading the direction we needed, that’s where they would be. We took advantage of having the car, as well, driving to all the different supposed hot spots around the west and north sides of the island to network our way onto a boat. It was then that someone told me about an app called Navily, where you can message boat owners directly who are either docked or even moored. This was a game-changer, because until that point we struggled to find ways to speak to moored boats. At one point, Jo even swam out to some boats to talk to them!

I started messaging people right away and, voila - we found someone willing to take us to Antigua. Two days of searching and we already had a boat to take us where we needed to go! They would be taking off on the 28th of December from Deshaies. This meant we could spend Christmas stress-free, knowing that we had a boat locked in.

This was an interesting Christmas for both of us. Our first tropical Christmas sounds like a dream, but without either of our families there, it was a bit tough. On Christmas Eve, we went and had dinner at a restaurant within walking distance of our apartment. We ended up eating dinner with a guy from the Brittany region of France and had a really, really lovely night. After that, we got to witness an incredible Guadeloupian tradition that our host told us used to be all over the island, but not is only in two or three neighborhoods, including the one we were in. The tradition involves people on some kind of organizational commitee who start at the top of the hill, at the first house of the neighborhood. They have an aperativo set up by the owner of that house. This lasts five or ten minutes, and then playing drums, they sign and dance their way down the hill to the next house. They repeat this at every house in the neighborhood. Once the group, which gets larger generally as they go along, leaves one house, that host cleans up then joins the group. They eventually end up on the beach, usually sometime early the next morning, and they continue to dance, sing, and celebrate until sometime in the afternoon on Christmas day. The energy was infectious and really quite fun. We joined them for a bit, but then got tired and went to bed. I couldn’t help but think about how wonderful of a tradition that is, particularly for anyone who might be alone on the holidays. 

We returned the car on Boxing Day and hitch-hiked our way back to Deshaies, where we spent one night in a hostel closer to the harbour. The boat taking us was a beautful catamaran owned by an lovely Autralian family. We met up for drinks the night before departure with them and their two crew members, and then the next morning at 7:30 we were onboard and on our way to Antigua.

The trip took about 6 hours. Upon arrival, the family decided to drop anchor and eat lunch before heading into port. Not only did they make an incredibly delicious lunch for themselves and their crew, but for us as well! Transportation and a meal, we could hardly believe our luck. After that, we said goodbye and began the treck from the English harbour to the Jolly Harbour, where apparently more boats go, again, before heading in the direction we need. This time we decided not to take any time for tourism and start looking for boat right away. Antigua, as we were quickly learning, is a very expensive island, one that we certainly couldn’t afford to stay on for too long. When we asked our taxi driver about more afforable accomodations in the area, he told us *Uhh… well sleeping on the beach is free!* He then went on to reassure us that this was both legal and very safe, there were guardians at the beach entrances and people apparently do this fairly regularly. So after some networking at the marina bar, we set up camp on the beach, tucked into some bushes in between two beach front mansions.

The next day, we got straight to work networking for boats, when Jo was tipped off about some catamarans that do deliveries to Saint Martin at fairly regular intervals. He was directed to the woman he should talk to about that, who informed him that there was a boat going January 4th and that it shouldn’t be a problem for us to get on it. Able to relax somewhat, we found a somewhat more affordable accomodation in the nearby Saint John’s and allowed ourselves to enjoy the island a bit more. This has mostly meant lots of running and beach-going.

We didn’t do much for New Years, deciding that staying in and celebrating together was better than trying to get tickets to any of the events happening on the island that cost more than $100 per ticket. More on our thoughts about Antigua to come, but for now, wish us luck that everything is okay for our departure on the 4th!
