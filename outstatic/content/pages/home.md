## Welcome to our extraordinary journey!

We're Julie from Canada and Jonathan from France, two passionate runners embarking on an incredible adventure - circumnavigating the globe without taking a single flight!

As members of the [Midnight Runners](https://www.midnightrunners.com/) community, we're connecting with fellow runners worldwide while making a meaningful impact through our partnership with [TeamUp](https://teamup.world/), an inspiring organization that creates life-changing opportunities through sport.

Our mission goes beyond just travel - we're visiting TeamUp's community development programs across continents, witnessing firsthand how sport can transform lives and build brighter futures. Currently, we're exploring the vibrant culture of Mexico, preparing for our exciting journey into South America.

Through this unique expedition, we're proving that sustainable travel isn't just possible - it's an opportunity to experience the world more deeply, connect with communities meaningfully, and contribute to positive change through the universal language of sport.

Join us as we run, sail, and journey across borders, sharing stories of determination, community, and the transformative power of sport. Follow our adventure as we combine our love for running with our commitment to making a difference in every community we visit!
