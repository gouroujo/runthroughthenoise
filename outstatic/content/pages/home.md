We are currently in Mindelo (Cabo verde), we just finished our comprehensive 2-weeks sailing training with [Marc Lepesqueux](https://www.routedurhum.com/en/skipper/235) last week on his boat from « Route du rhum » : [Maluel 40 (Class 40)](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:27/mmsi:228258700/imo:0/vessel:MALUEL40_SENSAT_C40).

We are now looking for a ship to cross the Atlantic in order to be in the Caribbean in January to continue our project. If you are looking for competent crew, we are available !

Beyond crewing the sailing part of your transatlantic trip, including night shifts, we can also cook, clean, provide language and/or fitness classes (between the two of us we speak fluent english, french, spanish, and are learning portuguese).

Jonathan is also a former volunteer first-aid instructor with 15 years of practice, decorated by the French government (Silver medal of homeland security) that can help to make your trip safer.

We are eager, kind, fun, no allergies or food restrictions, non-smoking, and can’t wait to help you have a great trip. We are also okay to pay a daily fee + our share of expenses to help you for the rest of your adventure across the globe.
