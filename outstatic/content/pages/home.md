We are currently in the Mindelo (Cabo verde), we just finished our sailing training with [Marc Lepesqueux](https://www.routedurhum.com/en/skipper/235) last week on his boat from « Route du rhum » : [Maluel 40 (Class 40)](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:27/mmsi:228258700/imo:0/vessel:MALUEL40_SENSAT_C40).

We are now looking for a ship to cross the Atlantic in order to be in the Caribbean in January to continue our project. If you are looking for crew, we are available !

Beyond crewing the sailing part of your transatlantic trip, including night shifts, we can also cook, clean, provide language and/or fitness classes (between the two of us we speak fluent english, french, spanish, and are learning portuguese). We are eager, kind, fun, no allergies or food restrictions, non-smoking, and can’t wait to help you have a great trip across the ocean.
